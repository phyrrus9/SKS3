Version 3.0.3:

Version 3.0.2:
	Developer mode changes. Mods can now use the following commands:

		map <int position> <char display> (set specific location)
		enginecmd <string command> <string value> (run engine command)
		if <string condition> <char op> <int value> (conditional statement, see below)
	Added to global:
		global constant (make mod auto reload on new level, useful for custom game modes)
	changed zombie:
		You may place zombies anywhere (randomly) on the map by using a negative number
		zombie -1
	CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS
		Conditional statements are useful in custom game modes, as they allow the programmer to
		define new functionality for different ideas. These follow the same procedure as require
		but with an entirely new set of "fields", called conditions. Currently the conditions are
		as follows:
			env->lc (completed levels)
